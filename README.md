Static Keyword in Object-Oriented Programming
Welcome to the repository for our university project focused on exploring the Static Keyword within Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project is part of our coursework and provides a hands-on implementation to deepen our understanding of static variables, methods, and blocks within OOP design.

Project Overview
This repository contains the code, documentation, and supplementary resources that demonstrate the use of the static keyword in OOP. The project illustrates practical applications, scenarios, and examples showcasing how static members and methods operate independently of class instances, providing valuable insight into memory management and shared resources.

Repository Link
Access the project repository at Static Keyword GitHub Repository.

Features
Static Variables: Demonstrates how static variables retain their values across all instances of a class.
Static Methods: Includes examples of static methods, which can be called without creating an instance of the class.
Static Blocks: Illustrates the use of static blocks for one-time initialization at class loading.
Technologies Used
Language: Java
IDE: Any Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
